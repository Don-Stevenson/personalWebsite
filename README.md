# A Personalized Portfolio Website

You can find my portolio site here: [https://donstevenson.netlify.app/](https://donstevenson.netlify.app/)

## About

Made with React JS, this website design and structure is based on a tutorial by [Garrett Love](https://github.com/garrettlove8/) with several important changes

- update from a structure that included both class and functional based React components to a fully functional, react hooks based approach
- update asynchronis code from a .then / promise approach to a more modern async / await within a try / catch error block type of approach.
- display gifs instead of static images on click
- use of process.env variables to store api keys
- creating and displaying error messages with the form fields
- the front end is deployed on netlify.com
- the back end handles emails from the contact form to my email acount and is deployed on heroku.com

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ede2f1e5-b63a-4050-b976-889a47a56d09/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/donstevenson/deploys)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
